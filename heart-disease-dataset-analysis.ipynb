The \"target\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued\r\nfrom 0 (no presence) and 1 (presence) and it will get stored in the target column. Target is the\r\ndependent variable and rests all the variable are the independent variable. We are analysing the\r\ndata to see the gender bifurcation for the patient having the heart diseases. As we are analysing\r\nthe clinical data set so, we are dealing with some of the clinical abbreviations.\r\n\r\n1) age: The person's age in years\r\n2) sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\r\n3) cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\r\n4) trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\r\n5) chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\r\n6) fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (if > 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)\r\n7) restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\r\n8) thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved\r\n9) exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\r\n10) oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot)\r\n11) slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\r\n12) ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)\r\n13) thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect)\r\n14) target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)\r\n\r\nLooking at information of heart disease risk factors led me to the following: high cholesterol,\r\nhigh blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking 3. According to another source 4,\r\nthe major factors that can't be changed are: increasing age, male gender and heredity. Note that thalassemia,\r\none of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: Smoking,\r\nhigh cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes.\r\nOther factors include stress, alcohol and poor diet/nutrition.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Loading the required library\r\nlibrary('corrplot')\r\nlibrary('tidyverse')\r\nlibrary('ggcorrplot')\r\nlibrary('ggplot2')\r\nlibrary('plyr') # to use count function\r\nlibrary('caret')\r\nlibrary('caTools')\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Importing the data file\r\ndata <- read_csv('../input/heart.csv')\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# DISPLAY THE FIRST FEW ROWS OF DATA\r\nhead(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS\r\nnrow(data)\r\nncol(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Understanding the datatype of dataset\r\nstr(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# DISPLAY THE SUMMARY\r\nsummary(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter analysing the summary of data we observe that no null/NA is present in our data but \r\nall the columns are considered as numeric even the categorical data as well. \r\nSo, we will perform some data preprocessing steps to convert the categorical column to factor.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Displaying the coralation matrix\r\ncorr <- cor(data)\r\n# Visualize the correlation matrix\r\ncorrplot(corr)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter observing above matrix we observe the our dependent varible is not/least related with \r\nfbs, chol, trestbps, restecg as they lies between [0.2, -0.2].

We will perform further analysis to find out more about the relevant parameter \r\nfor the causes of heart diseases.\r\n\r\n## Age variable Analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Counting the frequency of the values of the age\r\nageCount <- count(data, 'age')\r\nageCount <- subset(ageCount[which(ageCount$freq > 10), ])\r\n\r\n#ploting the age with frquency greater than 10\r\nggplot(ageCount, aes(x=ageCount$age, y=ageCount$freq)) + \r\n  ggtitle(\"Age Analysis\") +\r\n  xlab(\"Age\")  +\r\n  ylab(\"Age Count\") +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above plot we can observe that the data is present for patient is normally distributed. \r\nMajorirty of the patient are between 35-72 years of age. Few are also present for 30 years and \r\nfor 75 years old patient. On this range bases we will divide oue age into groups of young, middle, old.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Group the different ages in three groups (young, middle, old)\r\nyoung <- data[which((data$age<45)), ]\r\nmiddle <- data[which((data$age>=45)&(data$age<55)), ]\r\nelderly <- data[which(data$age>55), ]\r\ngroups <- data.frame(age_group = c(\"young\",\"middle\",\"elderly\"), group_count = c(NROW(young$age), NROW(middle$age), NROW(elderly$age)))\r\n\r\n#ploting different age groups\r\nggplot(groups, aes(x=groups$age_group, y=groups$group_count, fill=groups$age_group)) + \r\n  ggtitle(\"Age Analysis\") +\r\n  xlab(\"Age Group\")  +\r\n  ylab(\"group Count\") +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Age Group\", labels = c(\"Elderly\", \"Middle\", \"Young\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Adding the age groups to the dataset\r\ndata <- cbind(data, groups = ifelse((data$age<45), 0, ifelse((data$age>=45)&(data$age<55), 1, 2)))\r\ndata$groups <- as.factor(data$groups)\r\n# we will remove the age column as this is very generalised column and we have divided it, group, to include \r\n# that in our analysis more specifically.\r\n\r\ndata = subset(data, select = c(-age))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Discrete vs Discrete vs Discrete variable: age_group ~ target ~ sex\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= factor(data$groups), y=data$sex, colour=target)) + \r\n  geom_boxplot(stat = \"boxplot\",\r\n               position = \"dodge2\") +\r\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + \r\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +\r\n  xlab(\"Age Groups\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Gender\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of gender with different age group with presence or absense of heart disease\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above graph, As the age is increasing the chances of heart diseases decreases, which is just opposite \r\nto what I observe after doing basic research on the domain. \r\n\r\n## Sex variable analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar plot for sex\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= data$sex, fill=data$target)) + \r\n  geom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"Gender\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Gender Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of Gender\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs 0 representing Female and 1 representing male data. From the graph, we can observe that\r\nthe count of male patients is double as compared to female patients. We can conclude that the\r\nratio of male to female is 2:1 and heart diseases are more common among females as compared with\r\nmale. After doing the doamin research I got to know that heart disease doen't depend on the gender of the\r\npatients as it depends upon other factors like ECG, heart rate, blood pressure etc. Hence, we can remove this\r\nparamter before moving forward to next step of model implementation.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ndata = subset(data, select = c(-sex))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## cp (Chest Pain) variable Analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar plot for The chest pain experienced \r\nggplot(data, aes(x= cp, fill=cp)) + \r\n  geom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"Chest Pain Type\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of Chest Pain Experienced\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Chest Pain Type\", labels = c(\"Typical angina pain\", \"Atypical angina pain\", \"Non-Anginal pain\", \"Asymptomatic pain\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the plot, we can conclude that most of the patients have experienced typical angina type of chest pain.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar plot for The chest pain ~ target\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= cp, fill=target)) + \r\n  geom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"Chest Pain Type\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of Chest Pain Experienced\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above graph, we can observe that patient with typical angina pain has the least chances of heart disease, which is the most common type of cheast pain. Rest all other type have a equal chances of having a heart disease.\r\n\r\n## ca (number of major vessels) variable Analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar for ca (number of major vessels (0-3))\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= ca, fill=ca)) + \r\ngeom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"number of major vessels\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of number of major vessels\") +\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the graph, we can observe that most of the population doesn't have any major vessels. I can see no reference\r\nto the 'number of major vessels', but given that the definition of heart disease is \"...what happens when your\r\nheart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries\",\r\nit seems logical the more major vessels is a good thing, and therefore will reduce the probability of heart disease.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar for ca (number of major vessels (0-3))\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= ca, fill=target)) + \r\n  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') +\r\n  xlab(\"number of major vessels\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of number of major vessels\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above plot, we can see that as the number of major blood vessels increases, the probability of heart disease decreases. That makes sense, as it means more blood can get to the heart.\r\n\r\n## trestbps (resting blood pressure) variable analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Histogram for trestbps (resting blood pressure)\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=trestbps)) + \r\n  geom_histogram() +\r\n  xlab(\"Resting blood pressure\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of blood pressure\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above histogram, we can analyse that the data is now normally distributed but we can also observe that outliers are present in the data. So, we remove the outliers from the data.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# removing the outliers\r\ndata$trestbps = ifelse(data$trestbps > 180, NA, data$trestbps)\r\ndata$trestbps = ifelse(is.na(data$trestbps), median(data$trestbps[which(!is.na(data$trestbps))]), data$trestbps)\r\n\r\n# After the removal of outliers\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=trestbps)) + \r\n  geom_histogram() +\r\n  xlab(\"Resting blood pressure\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of blood pressure\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNormal range for blood pressure is between 90-140 and we can observe that most of the population have their blood pressure under this range. Now, let analyse its impact on heart disease.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Density graph for trestbps (resting blood pressure)\r\nggplot(data, aes(x = trestbps, fill = target)) +\r\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above graph, we can observe that patients equal chances of having heart disease irrespective of the value of blood pressure. This observation is just opposite to what we thought. So, we can remove this parameter before model implementation.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ndata = subset(data, select = c(-trestbps))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## oldpeak variable analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Histogram for oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=oldpeak)) + \r\n  geom_histogram() +\r\n  xlab(\"ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the above histogram, we can observe that the graph is right-skewed so, we performed the transformation on the data. As, the data contains o's as value so we will transformed it using log1p()\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# From the above histogram \r\ndata$oldpeak <- log1p(data$oldpeak)\r\n\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=oldpeak)) + \r\n  geom_histogram() +\r\n  xlab(\"ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the transformation, we can analyse that the data is now normally distributed. But we observe that there is a peak on for the zero value. Now, Let's analyse the effect of oldpeak on chances of patients to have heart disease.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Density plot for oldpeak ~ target\r\nggplot(data, aes(x = oldpeak, fill = target)) +\r\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +\r\n  xlab(\"ST depression induced\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of ST depression induced and presence of heart disease\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above graph, we can observe that as the value oldpeak increases the chances of heart disease decreases.\r\n\r\n## Slope variable analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar plot for slope (slope of the peak exercise ST segment) \r\ndata$slope <- ifelse(data$slope == 0, 1, print(data$slope))\r\ndata$slope <- as.factor(data$slope)\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=data$slope, fill=data$slope)) + \r\n  geom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"Slope of ST segment\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of slope of the peak exercise ST segment\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Slope of ST segment\", labels = c(\"Upsloping\", \"Flat\", \"Downsloping\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the graph above, we can observe almost equal number of paients lies in the flat and downsloping slope.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Plot for slope ~ target\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= slope, fill=target)) + \r\n  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') +\r\n  xlab(\"slope of the peak exercise ST segment\") +\r\n  ylab(\"count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of slope of the peak exercise ST segment with presence or absense of heart disease\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above graph we can observe that the paients with downsloping slope have higher chances of having a heart disease as compared to flat slope.\r\n\r\n## thalach (maximum heart rate achieved) variable analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Histogram for thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=thalach)) + \r\ngeom_histogram() +\r\n  xlab(\"Maximum heart rate achieved\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of maximum heart rate achieved\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above histogram, we can analyse that the data is now normally distributed but we can also observe that outliers are present in the data. So, we remove the outliers from the data.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Replacing the outlier value with median value of thalach\r\ndata$thalach = ifelse(data$thalach < 75, NA, data$thalach)\r\ndata$thalach = ifelse(is.na(data$thalach), median(data$thalach[which(!is.na(data$thalach))]), data$thalach)\r\n\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=thalach)) + \r\n  geom_histogram() +\r\n  xlab(\"Maximum heart rate achieved\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of maximum heart rate achieved\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the outlier replacement we can analyse that the data is now normally distributed. Now, let's analyse this parameter's effect on presence of heart disease\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Density plot for thalach ~ target\r\nggplot(data, aes(x = thalach, fill = target)) +\r\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +\r\n  xlab(\"Maximum Heart Rate Achieved\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of relation of heart rate with presence of heart disease\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the plot we can observe that as the value of heart rate inceases the chances of having a heart disease increases.\r\n\r\n## thal (blood disorder called thalassemia) variable analysis\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar graph for thal (blood disorder called thalassemia)\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=thal)) + \r\ngeom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"Blood disorder type\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of blood disorder (thalassemia)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nForm the above graph, we can observe that some patients having 0 value as this is a invalid value as valid categories are 2 = 'normal' 3 = 'fixed defect' 4 = 'reversable defect'. so, will replace this value by taking mode of all values.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Replacing the invalid value with mode value of thal\r\ndata$thal = ifelse(data$thal == 0, 2, data$thal)\r\ndata$thal <- as.factor(data$thal)\r\n\r\nggplot(data, aes(x=thal, fill=thal)) + \r\n  geom_bar() +\r\n  xlab(\"Blood disorder type\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of blood disorder (thalassemia)\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Blood disorder\", labels = c(\"Normal\", \"Fixed defect\", \"reversable defect\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can observe from the above graph that maximum population in our dataset has either fixed the defect or don't have the disorder.Now, let's analyse this parameter's effect on presence of heart disease\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Bar plot for thal ~ target\r\nggplot(data, aes(x= thal, fill=target)) + \r\n  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') +\r\n  xlab(\"blood disorder\") +\r\n  ylab(\"count\") +\r\n  ggtitle(\"Analysis of blood disorder with presence or absense of heart disease\") +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Heart disease\", labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above graph, we can observe that patients got treated for thalassemia has higher chances of having heart disease. We can observe that heart diseases highly influenced by hereditary diseases \r\n\r\n## Conculsion of EDA\r\n\r\nAt the start,I hypothesised, using (Googled) domain knowledge that factors such as cholesterol and age would be \r\nmajor factors in the model. This dataset didn't show that. Instead, the number of major factors and aspects of ECG \r\nresults dominated. I actually feel like I've learnt a thing or two about heart disease!\r\n\r\n## Model implementation\r\n\r\nAs the paremeter (target), I am analysing is a binary variable having values as 0 and 1. So, I am implementing \r\nlogistic regression for predicting the dependent variable values.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# To get the same set every time we run the code\r\nset.seed(123)\r\n\r\n# Rearranging the columns to make the target as the last column\r\ndata <- data[, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8)]\r\n\r\n# Dividing the data set in train and test datasets\r\ndataSample <- sample.split(data[,ncol(data)-1], SplitRatio=0.80)\r\ntrainSet = subset(data,dataSample == TRUE)\r\ntestSet = subset(data,dataSample == FALSE)\r\n\r\n# Creating a logistic model\r\nlogisticmodel <- glm(target~.,data = trainSet, family = \"binomial\")\r\n\r\n# Summary of the created model\r\nsummary(logisticmodel)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Interpretation\r\n\r\nThe coefficient estimate of the variable cp is b = 0.857, which is positive. This means that an increase in cp is associated with increase in the probability of having a heart disease. However the coefficient for the variable thalach is b = -0.002, which is negative. This means that an increase in blood disorder will be associated with a decreased probability of having a heart disease.\r\n\r\ncp(Chest Pain) and ca(number of major vessels are the most significant variable for predicting the presence of heart disease.\r\n\r\nThe z-test value is associated with testing the significance of the parameter listed in the first column. z-test value of 0.649 refers to the z-test of the (Intercept) 1.514733 divided by the standard error of that estimate 2.332198.\r\n\r\nThe AIC value is used to state the goodness of the model. The smaller the value of AIC the better the model performing.\r\n\r\nFor interpreting the logistic beta coefficients, is the odds ratio. An odds ratio measures the association between a predictor variable (x) and the outcome variable (y). It represents the ratio of the odds that an event will occur (event = 1) given the presence of the predictor x (x = 1), compared to the odds of the event occurring in the absence of that predictor (x = 0).\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for thalach is -0.002. This indicate that one unit increase in the value of thalach will decrease the odds of having a heart disease by exp(-0.002) 0.998 times.\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for oldpeak is -0.930. This indicate that one unit increase in the value of oldpeak will decrease the odds of having a heart disease by exp(-0.930) 0.394 times.\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for exang1 is -0.878. This indicate that selecting exang1 over exang0 will decrease the chances of having a heart disease by exp(-0.878) 0.415 times.\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for slope2 is -0.877. This indicate that selecting slope2 over slope1 will decrease the chances of having a heart disease by exp(-0.877) 0.416 times.\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for cp1 is 0.857. This indicate that selecting cp1 over cp0 will increase the chances of having a heart disease by exp(-0.857) 0.424 times.\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for ca1 is -2.029. This indicate that selecting ca1 over ca0 will decrease the chances of having a heart disease by exp(-2.029) 0.131 times.\r\n\r\nThe regression coefficient for thal3 is 0.870. This indicate that selecting thal3 over thal2 will increase the chances of having a heart disease by exp(0.870) 2.386 times.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Making prediction with the above model\r\npredictdata <- predict(logisticmodel, newdata = testSet[, -9], type=\"response\")\r\npred <- ifelse(predictdata>=0.5,1,0)\r\npred <- as.factor(pred)\r\nobserved <- testSet[,9]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# Checking the accuracy of the model\r\nconfusionMatrix(pred, observed)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the confusion matrix we can observe, our model is 81% accurate. 20 values of o's predicted correctly and 30 values of 1's is predicted corrected out of total 61 values.\r\nWe can analyse from the above output that the number of patients having a heart disease is more than those who doesn't have a heart disease.\r\nWe can say that after apply the model we are sure on the analysis made  while EDA that the heart disease depends more on the system or test results more than than the others factors and the number of heart patients are more in both the trianing as well as in testing set.\r\n","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_kg_hide-input":false},"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
